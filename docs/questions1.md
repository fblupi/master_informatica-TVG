## Issues about Medical Imaging Modalities

**1.- X-ray images rely upon two underlying physical phenomena: *absortion* and *scattering* which provoke X-ray *attenuation*. Which are the effects that these two phenomena produce onto final X-ray images?**

Respuesta

**2.- How influences the kind of beam X-rays, soft or hard, on the type of tissues that can be clearly perceived in the final X-ray image?**

Respuesta

**3.- Describe the physical model of attenuation for X-rays.**

Respuesta

**4.- Enumerate the properties of the images coming from X-ray Rotational Angiography.**

Respuesta

**5.- Which are the parameters of CT scanning and how influence the visual quality of the final 3D image (volume)**

Respuesta

**6.- MRI exploits the occurrence of hydrogen nucle in human tissue for image generation. The MRI device measures two times that take into account the time between *phase* (the protons are misaligned in a magnetic field) and *dephase* (the protons realign with the magnetic field). Looking at the slides titled "Magnetic Resonance Imaging: T1 and T2", can you describe how to discriminate between different tissue types ausing the plots of the bottom?**

Respuesta

**7.- Compare CT imaging properties against to MRI imaging properties.**
