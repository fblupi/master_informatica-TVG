## Issues about Analysis for Medical Visualization

1. **There are two main categories of spatial processing: *intensity transformations* and *spatial (kernel) filtering*. Describe the general idea in which they rely upon and the underlying general functions.**

Respuesta

2. **Noise reduction filtering aims to reduce inhomogneities in medical images. Which does noise level depends on in medical imaging?**

Respuesta

3. **The binomial (Gaussian) filter for noise elimination is a static noise reduction filter. Describe it. Why are the static noise reduction filter scaled so that the sum of their elements is 1?**

Respuesta

4. **Explain the *property of separability* for filters and the main problem of static filters.**

Respuesta

5. **The sigma-filter is a paradigmatic case of dynamic noise reduction filters. Describe it.**

Respuesta

6. **Describe the threshold-based segmentation method and relates it with the segmentation methods provides by ITK.**

Respuesta

7. **Describe the procedure to obtain a watershed segmentation image, including the merging component.**

Respuesta

8. **Describe the different steps carried on by livewire edge-based segmentation approach.**

Respuesta

9. **How can you use morphologic operators to reduce noise? What kind of morphologic to take into account (transformation and similarity measure).**
